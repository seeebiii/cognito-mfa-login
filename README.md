This is a pet project to play around with a few Cognito & Amplify features and figure out how it works.

## Features

- Deploy Cognito user pool, client and Lambda Triggers using CDK
  - Lambda triggers implement Custom Auth flow in Cognito
- Start a local React frontend using Amplify to test flows like register, login & forget password
